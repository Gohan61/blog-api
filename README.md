<h1>A blog with a separate front+backend</h1>

This project uses a backend only API and two separate frontends.

The backend provides the routes, authorization, authentication and queries to the database.

The user frontend is for user to read the blog and place comments if logged in:
<a href='https://main--blog-api-user-frontend.netlify.app/'>User frontend of The Blog</a>

The author/admin frontend is for authors to write and publish/unpublish posts and delete comments if necessary. Only authors can login here.
<a href='https://main--blog-admin-frontend-odin.netlify.app/'>Author frontend of The Blog</a>
